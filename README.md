# spring-cloud-microservices

Spring Cloud helps you take full advantage of developing microservices in the cloud. Learn how to develop cloud-native apps that utilize service discovery, distributed config, client-side load balancing, intelligent routing, and fault tolerance.

- Services discovery using Spring Cloud and Netflix Eureka 
- Distributed configuration using Spring Cloud Config Server 
- Client-side load balancing using Spring Cloud and Netflix Ribbon 
- Intelligent routing via a gateway service using Spring Cloud and Netflix Zuul
- Fault tolerance using Spring Cloud and Netflix Hystrix. 

## Service Discovery Service

Provides :
- A way for a service to register and deregister itself
- A way for a client to find other services
- A way to check the health of a service and remove the unhealthy instances.

Some tools that provides the discovery services are:
- Spring Cloud Consul
